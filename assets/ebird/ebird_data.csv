Abbott's booby,"{""Abbott's Booby"": {'Order': 'Suliformes', 'Family': 'Sulidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Papasula abbotti', 'Description': 'Gangly, stretched-out-looking black-and-white seabird. Strikingly slender and strange-looking in flight. Breeds in the rainforest canopy of Christmas Island, and forages in the adjacent ocean. Some birds, especially immatures, will forage much farther afield, but the extent of these rangings is still poorly understood. Bizarre long-necked and slender-winged profile is unique, and should readily distinguish this species from any others in range. Bill is pale pink in females and grayish in males.'}}"
Abbott's starling,"{""Abbott's Starling"": {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Sturnidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Poeoptera femoralis', 'Description': 'A small, distinctive starling with a tiny range in Kenya and Tanzania. The male has a blue-black back and breast and a white belly. Females have a brown back and breast and a pale belly with brown streaks. Both sexes show a yellow eye. Uncommon and local in montane forest. Found in the canopy, in pairs or small flocks, often perching up conspicuously on dead snags and other open perches. Similar to Sharpe’s Starling, but has a dark breast. The calls include a sharp “sveet” and the song is a rapid, high-pitched tinkling phrase.'}}"
