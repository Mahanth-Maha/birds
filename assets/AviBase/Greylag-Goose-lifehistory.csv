"avibase-4AED44E8","DISTRIB","ANNUAL","Species distribution","Geographical range","Breeds from Iceland, the British Isles, and Scandinavia east through central Europe and Russia to central and southern Siberia and southern Russian Far East and south to Turkey, Iraq, Iran, possibly extreme western Afghanistan, and northern China. Northernmost populations are migratory. Winters south to North Africa, Israel, Iraq, northern India, central Myanmar, northern Vietnam, and southern China. Casual north to Svalbard, Jan Mayen, east to Japan, and south to the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Egypt, Kuwait, and Sri Lanka. Casual north to Greenland where there are at least seven sight records (Boertmann 1994 and D. Boertmann in litt.). Accidental off Newfoundland; one landed and was photographed aboard a ship 167 nautical miles off St. John’s, from 24 April to 2 May 2005 (Pranty et al. 2008). This species is widely kept domestically, and most if not all reports from mainland North America likely represent escapes from captivity. A report from Attu Island (1987, Amer. Birds 41:476) pertains to either Anser fabalis or A. serrirostris (1988, Amer. Birds 42:121; D.D. Gibson in litt.).","","","","","AOU Checklist","http://www.aou.org/checklist/north/print.php"
