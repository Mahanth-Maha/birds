Wintered in Chile and on the plains of Argentina. The southward migration route was from the coast of Labra- dor, New England and Long Island over the Atlantic Ocean, returning northward across the Gulf of Mexico and up the Mississippi Valley. Now virtually extinct.","","","","","Peter's Checklist of the Birds of the World","http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/14581"
