Migrates from interior breeding grounds to coastal wintering areas. Casual in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, Europe, northwestern and western Africa, and Kerguelen Islands. Accidental in central coastal California (one photographed and measured at Bolinas Lagoon, Marin County, 29 January-8 April 2001; Abbott et al. 2001).","","","","","AOU Checklist","http://www.aou.org/checklist/north/print.php"
